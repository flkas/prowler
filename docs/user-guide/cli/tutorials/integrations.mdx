## Integration with Slack

Prowler can be integrated with [Slack](https://slack.com/) to send a summary of the execution having configured a Slack APP in your channel with the following command:

```sh
prowler <provider> --slack
```

<Note>
Slack integration needs `SLACK_API_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME` environment variables.

</Note>
### Configuration of the Integration with Slack

To configure the Slack Integration, follow the next steps:

1. Create a Slack Application:
    - Go to [Slack API page](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/getting-a-token), scroll down to the *Create app* button and select your workspace:
    ![Create Slack App](/images/cli/create-slack-app.png)

    - Install the application in your selected workspaces:

    - Get the *Slack App OAuth Token* that Prowler needs to send the message:

2. Optionally, create a Slack Channel (you can use an existing one)

3. Integrate the created Slack App to your Slack channel:
    - Click on the channel, go to the Integrations tab, and Add an App.

4. Set the following environment variables that Prowler will read:
    - `SLACK_API_TOKEN`: the *Slack App OAuth Token* that was previously get.
    - `SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME`: the name of your Slack Channel where Prowler will send the message.

## Integration with Google Chat

Prowler can also post scan summaries to [Google Chat](https://workspace.google.com/products/chat/) spaces using incoming webhooks and Cards v2 messages:

```sh
prowler <provider> --google-chat
```

<Note>
Google Chat integration requires a `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL`. Optional overrides include `GOOGLE_CHAT_SPACE_NAME` (subtitle shown in the card header) and `GOOGLE_CHAT_CARD_HEADER` (title shown in the card header).
</Note>

### Configuration of the Integration with Google Chat

1. **Create or select a space** in Google Chat where you want to receive Prowler alerts.
2. **Add an incoming webhook** to the space:
   - In the space, open *Manage webhooks* and create a new webhook.
   - Give the webhook a descriptive name (e.g., `Prowler Alerts`) and copy the generated URL (it should start with `https://chat.googleapis.com/`).
3. **Set the environment variables** that Prowler will read before running the CLI:
   - `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL`: the webhook endpoint copied in the previous step.
   - `GOOGLE_CHAT_SPACE_NAME` *(optional)*: overrides the subtitle shown in the card header.
   - `GOOGLE_CHAT_CARD_HEADER` *(optional)*: custom title for the card header.
4. **Run Prowler with the `--google-chat` flag** using the same provider arguments you use today.

Prowler sends a Cards v2 payload that includes the provider identity, pass/fail counts with severity breakdowns, resources scanned, and the CLI parameters used in the run. The card subtitle points to your instance URL when `AUTH_URL` (or `PROWLER_URL`) is available in the environment, otherwise it falls back to `https://prowler.com`. You can still override the subtitle with `GOOGLE_CHAT_SPACE_NAME` if you prefer a custom label.
